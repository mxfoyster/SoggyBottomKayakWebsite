# Soggy Bottom Kayak Website

Welcome to my repository for my Kayak Club Website.

I have made this website to fulfil some of my learning objectives for my Level 3 Coding Concepts course. It is partial as the main purpose is as a discussion topic for software security, authentication, databases etc.
I have just started to have a go with Github pages as an alternative to Github Wiki, it's new to me and I'll play around with it in the coming days. Therefore, don't eb surprised if you don't see much here to start with. 
## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/mxfoyster/SoggyBottomKayakWebsite/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/mxfoyster/SoggyBottomKayakWebsite/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
