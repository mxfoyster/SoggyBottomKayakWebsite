<h3>Welcome</h3>

<p>Welcome to Soggy Bottom Kayak Club. We love our kayaks but we use Paddleboards and Canoes too. 
In fact, if you can paddle it, we can teach it.</p>

<p>Yeah okay. Listen, this is very important, I forgot my video camera, could you stop by my place and pick it up on your way to the mall? Did you hurt your head? Of course, the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance they're supposed to go to this, that's where they kiss for the first time. No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need.</p>

<p>Who the hell is John F. Kennedy? That's a great idea. I'd love to park. That's George McFly. Okay Doc, this is it. In that case, I'll tell you strait out.</p>

<p>What, what is it hot? Actually, people call me Marty. Ho, you mean you're gonna touch her on her- Of course, from a group of Libyan Nationalists. They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn gave them a shiny bomb case full of used pinball machine parts. The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car why not do it with some style. Besides, the stainless, steel construction made the flux dispersal- look out.</p>

<p>Hi. It's a board with wheels. Well, ma, we talked about this, we're not gonna go to the lake, the car's wrecked. Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to get them re-typed. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting. I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen would you? Would you? Yet.</p>
